# BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding
This project focuses on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a deep learning model developed by Google for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. BERT improves machine understanding of human language by using a bidirectional training approach, which helps capture the context of words more effectively.
Key Features
•	Bidirectional Training: Understands words based on both previous and future context.
•	Pre-training & Fine-tuning: The model is first pre-trained on a large text corpus and later fine-tuned for specific tasks.
•	Transformer Architecture: Uses self-attention mechanisms to improve text representation.
•	State-of-the-Art Performance: Achieves high accuracy in sentiment analysis, question answering, and text classification.
Technologies Used
Deep Learning Frameworks:
•	TensorFlow / PyTorch – Used for training and fine-tuning BERT.
•	Transformers (Hugging Face) – Implementation and optimization of BERT models.
NLP Tasks Covered:
•	Sentiment Analysis – Understanding text emotions (positive/negative).
•	Question Answering – Extracting relevant answers from context.
•	Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Identifying proper names, locations, etc.
How It Works
1.	Pre-training: The model is trained on massive text datasets to learn word representations.
2.	Fine-tuning: BERT is adapted to specific NLP tasks like classification and text summarization.
3.	Evaluation: Performance is tested using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Results & Challenges
•	Baseline Model Accuracy: ~62.67% (Logistic Regression).
•	BERT Model Accuracy: Improved contextual understanding but faced class imbalance issues.
•	Challenges: High computational requirements and potential biases in training data.
Future Scope
•	Optimize training efficiency to reduce computational costs.
•	Improve model generalization on smaller datasets.
•	Enhance interpretability for better model insights.
